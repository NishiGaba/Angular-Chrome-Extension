## Things you gonna need ?
* ### Angular CLI

    #### Why Angular CLI needed :
    Technically, you‚Äôre not required to use Angular CLI to develop an Angular application, but its many features can highly       improve the quality of your code and automate your development workflow eventually save you a lot of time along the way .

## Let's begin the process

So, lets buckle up to start the small but adventurous journey of making a <strong>Chrome Extension with Angular</strong>:rocket:

### Step 1
Create a new App with Angular CLI using ["ng new <app-name>"](https://angular.io/cli/new) command such as:
![JSPanther_Angular_App](https://github.com/jspanther/Angular-Chrome-Extension/blob/master/src/assets/img/first.png)
  
### Step 2
Now, we need to switch to the project directory using command "cd /project-directory". We can check the directory content by running "ls" command and now we can run our Angular application by running ["ng serve"](https://angular.io/cli/serve) such as:
![JSPanther_Angular_App](https://github.com/jspanther/Angular-Chrome-Extension/blob/master/src/assets/img/second.png)

After this, you can check the URL "localhost:4200" in your browser and home page looks like this:

### Step 3
add the updated app.component.ts,app.component.html, style.css
//add unsplash api as well
ng serve
// show image

### Step 4
make build -> dist

### Step 5
create manifest inside dist, manifest file link,, version 2, use of manifest.json

### Step 6
add icons, logos, images

### Step 7
check locally, unpacked chrome extension // developer tools

### Step 8
zip package

### Step 9
Google web store payment and form submission

### Step 10
package upload with updated versions and images

### Step 11
save draft and publish

Voila, All done :D
